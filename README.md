üõ°Ô∏è WOC: The Weaponization of Character
An Interactive Exploration of Modern Political Warfare

This project explores the systematic "weaponization of character" as an emerging and insidious threat to the national security of Western democracies. Moving beyond traditional espionage and cyber-attacks, this new doctrine of conflict targets the very integrity of our institutions and leaders. Through three distinct interactive reports, this repository delves into the methods, case studies, and strategic implications of this corrosive form of statecraft.

üöÄ The Interactive Reports
This repository hosts three unique web-based reports, each offering a different lens through which to understand the weaponization of character.

üéØ Core Concepts Explored
This project is built on a foundation of key strategic concepts that define this new era of conflict.

What is the "Weaponization of Character"?

It is the deliberate, often long-term cultivation of political, business, and cultural elites by a hostile state actor. This process exploits their personal, financial, and psychological vulnerabilities‚Äîsuch as ego, greed, or compromised ethics‚Äîthrough channels that are frequently legal and non-criminal. Moving beyond simple intelligence gathering, its ultimate aim is to achieve strategic influence and policy subversion from within the target state's power structures.

The Modernized MICE Framework

Our analysis adapts the classic counterintelligence framework to the modern context of elite cultivation:

M - Money: Strategic financial flows (donations, business deals) that create obligation and grant access.

I - Ideology: Amplifying pre-existing sympathies (e.g., nationalism) to align targets with foreign goals.

C - Compromise: Using real or fabricated personal secrets (kompromat) to create silent leverage and ensure compliance.

E - Ego: Exploiting a target's vanity and desire for prestige through flattery, awards, and exclusive access.

Sovereignty vs. Secrecy

A crucial distinction that defines this threat:

Traditional Espionage targets Secrecy to steal information.

Character Weaponization targets Sovereignty to subvert a nation's ability to act in its own interest.
